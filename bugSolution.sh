# This script is the corrected version of the buggy script.
# The loop condition has been fixed to correctly process all files.

# Directory to process
dir="/tmp/mydir"

# Create some dummy files
mkdir -p "$dir"
touch "$dir/file1.txt" "$dir/file2.txt" "$dir/file3.txt"

# Correct loop condition
while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' file; do
  echo "Processing: $file"
  # Process the file here...
done < <(find "$dir" -type f -print0)

# Clean up
rm -rf "$dir"
